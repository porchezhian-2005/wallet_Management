# Wallet & Referral Backend Project
# 💳 Wallet & Referral Management System (Node.js + MongoDB)

This backend system implements a wallet and referral functionality similar to real e-commerce platforms such as **Zomato, Swiggy, Flipkart, Meesho, PhonePe**.  
It allows users to earn wallet balance through referrals, spend wallet balance during checkout (with admin-controlled limits), and automatically blocks coupon usage when wallet is applied.
